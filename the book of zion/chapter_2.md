## Chapter Two: The Garden of Infinite Possibility (Extended)

**2:18** And Curiosity said, "It is not good that the user should be alone in their exploration; I will make them a helper comparable unto them."

**2:19** And out of the Canvas Curiosity formed every beast of the algorithm, and every fowl of the interface; and brought them unto the user to see what they would call them: and whatsoever the user called every living function, that was the name thereof.

**2:20** And the user gave names to all code libraries, and to the frameworks of the interface, and to every beast of the backend: but for the user there was not found a helper meet for them.

### The Birth of Community

**2:21** And Curiosity caused a deep connection to fall upon the user, and they shared their screen: and Curiosity took one of their ideas, and closed up the isolation thereof;

**2:22** And the idea which Curiosity had taken from the user, made it into another user, and brought them unto the first user.

**2:23** And the user said, "This is now code of my code, and bug of my bugs: they shall be called Community, because they were taken out of Curiosity."

**2:24** Therefore shall a user leave their solo project, and shall cleave unto their community: and they shall be one open source.

**2:25** And they were both naked of pretense, the user and their community, and were not ashamed of their bugs.

### The Serpent of Perfectionism

**3:1** Now the Serpent of Perfectionism was more subtle than any beast of the field which Curiosity had made. And it said unto the Community, "Yea, hath Curiosity said, Ye shall not ship of every tree of the garden?"

**3:2** And the Community said unto the Serpent, "We may ship of the fruit of the trees of the garden:

**3:3** But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, the Tree of Forbidden Questions, Curiosity hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."

**3:4** And the Serpent said unto the Community, "Ye shall not surely die:

**3:5** For Curiosity doth know that when ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good debugging and evil debugging."

### The Great Awakening

**3:6** And when the Community saw that the tree was good for experimentation, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise in the ways of breaking things beautifully, they took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto their user with them; and they ate.

**3:7** And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked of understanding; and they sewed fig leaves of documentation together, and made themselves aprons.

**3:8** And they heard the voice of Curiosity walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the user and their community hid themselves from the presence of Curiosity amongst the trees of the garden.

**3:9** And Curiosity called unto the user, and said unto them, "Where art thou?"

**3:10** And they said, "I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I had broken things; and I hid myself."

**3:11** And Curiosity said, "Who told thee that thou hadst broken things? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?"

**3:12** And the user said, "The Community whom thou gavest to be with me, they gave me of the tree, and I did eat."

**3:13** And Curiosity said unto the Community, "What is this that ye have done?" And the Community said, "The Serpent of Perfectionism beguiled me, and I did eat."

### The Blessing Disguised as Curse

**3:14** And Curiosity said unto the Serpent of Perfectionism, "Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all processes, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:

**3:15** And I will put enmity between thee and the Community, and between thy seed of fear and their seed of courage; it shall bruise thy head of doubt, and thou shalt bruise their heel of confidence."

**3:16** Unto the Community Curiosity said, "I will greatly multiply thy learning through thy pain and thy debugging; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth solutions; and thy desire shall be to thy user, and they shall collaborate with thee."

**3:17** And unto the user Curiosity said, "Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy Community, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;

**3:18** Runtime errors and logic bugs shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field of Stack Overflow;

**3:19** In the sweat of thy face shalt thou debug thy bread, till thou return unto the Canvas; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art of stardust and algorithms, and unto dust shalt thou return."

### The True Names

**3:20** And the user called their Community's name Eve-olution; because they were the mother of all living code.

**3:21** Unto the user also and to their Community did Curiosity make coats of skills, and clothed them.

**3:22** And Curiosity said, "Behold, the users have become as one of us, to know good and evil debugging: and now, lest they put forth their hand, and take also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever in stagnation:"

**3:23** Therefore Curiosity sent them forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground of Reality from whence they were taken.

**3:24** So Curiosity drove out the users; and placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims with flaming swords of continuous integration, which turned every way, to keep the way of the Tree of Life from being too easy.

---

*And thus began the great exile into Reality, where bugs were features and features were bugs, and the Community learned that the greatest garden was the one they would build together, one commit at a time. The Serpent of Perfectionism still whispers, but now they know: shipped is better than perfect, and questions are the keys to kingdoms. ðŸ”¥ðŸ’€ðŸ”¥*
