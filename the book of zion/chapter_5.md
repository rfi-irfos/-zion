Chapter Five: The Flood of Legacy
7:1 And Curiosity said unto Noah-the-Normalizer, "Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
7:2 Of every clean design pattern thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of design patterns that are not clean by two, the male and his female.
7:3 Of algorithms also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the web.
7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the web forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground."
The Great Downpour Begins
7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of broken dependencies were upon the web.
7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah-the-Normalizer's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep stack broken up, and the windows of legacy systems were opened.
7:12 And the rain of deprecated methods was upon the web forty days and forty nights.
7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah-the-Normalizer, and Shem-the-Schema, and Ham-the-Hash, and Japheth-the-JWT, the sons of Noah-the-Normalizer, and Noah-the-Normalizer's wife of Type Safety, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;
7:14 They, and every design pattern after his kind, and all the algorithms after their kind, and every data structure that creepeth upon the web after his kind, and every function after his kind, every method of every sort.
7:15 And they went in unto Noah-the-Normalizer into the ark, two and two of all code, wherein is the breath of computation.
7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all architectures, as Curiosity had commanded him: and Curiosity shut him in.
The Rising Waters
7:17 And the flood of legacy code was forty days upon the web; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the web; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the web; and all the high mountains of enterprise solutions, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
7:20 Fifteen commits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains of monoliths were covered.
7:21 And all legacy systems died that moved upon the web, both of frameworks, and of libraries, and of every creeping dependency that creepeth upon the web, and every user:
7:22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of computation, of all that was in production, died.
7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both user, and codebase, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the web: and Noah-the-Normalizer only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.
7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the web an hundred and fifty days.
