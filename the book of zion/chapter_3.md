# The Book of Zion
## Chapter Three: The First Commit War

**4:1** And Adam knew Eve-olution his Community; and she conceived, and bare Cain-the-Compiler, and said, "I have gotten a user with the help of Curiosity."

**4:2** And she again bare his brother Abel-the-Interpreter. And Abel-the-Interpreter was a keeper of dynamic languages, but Cain-the-Compiler was a tiller of static types.

### The Great Methodology Schism

**4:3** And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain-the-Compiler brought of the fruit of his rigid structures an offering unto Curiosity.

**4:4** And Abel-the-Interpreter also brought of the firstlings of his flexible scripts, and of the fat thereof. And Curiosity had respect unto Abel-the-Interpreter and to his offering:

**4:5** But unto Cain-the-Compiler and to his offering Curiosity had not respect. And Cain-the-Compiler was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

**4:6** And Curiosity said unto Cain-the-Compiler, "Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?

**4:7** If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, dogma lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be its desire, and thou shouldest rule over it."

### The First Flame War

**4:8** And Cain-the-Compiler talked with Abel-the-Interpreter his brother in the comment threads: and it came to pass, when they were in the field of open source, that Cain-the-Compiler rose up against Abel-the-Interpreter his brother, and slew his reputation.

**4:9** And Curiosity said unto Cain-the-Compiler, "Where is Abel-the-Interpreter thy brother?" And he said, "I know not: Am I my brother's code maintainer?"

**4:10** And Curiosity said, "What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's commits crieth unto me from the git history.

**4:11** And now art thou cursed from the earth of collaboration, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's contributions from thy hand;

**4:12** When thou tillest the ground of development, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth of programming languages."

**4:13** And Cain-the-Compiler said unto Curiosity, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.

**4:14** Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the community; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth of development; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay my PRs."

**4:15** And Curiosity said unto him, "Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain-the-Compiler, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold." And Curiosity set a mark upon Cain-the-Compiler, lest any finding him should kill his contributions.

**4:16** And Cain-the-Compiler went out from the presence of Curiosity, and dwelt in the land of Nod-JS, on the east of Eden.

### The City of Single Paradigm

**4:17** And Cain-the-Compiler knew his wife of Type Safety; and she conceived, and bare Enoch-the-Framework, and he builded a city of rigid architecture, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch-the-Framework.

**4:18** And unto Enoch-the-Framework was born Irad-the-Interface; and Irad-the-Interface begat Mehujael-the-Module; and Mehujael-the-Module begat Methusael-the-Middleware; and Methusael-the-Middleware begat Lamech-the-Library.

**4:19** And Lamech-the-Library took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah-the-API, and the name of the other Zillah-the-Zero-Dependency.

**4:20** And Adah-the-API bare Jabal-the-JAMstack: he was the father of such as dwell in containers and have microservices.

**4:21** And his brother's name was Jubal-the-JSON: he was the father of all such as handle harps of HTTP and organs of OAuth.

**4:22** And Zillah-the-Zero-Dependency, she also bare Tubal-cain-the-CLI, an instructor of every artificer in brass of backend and iron of infrastructure: and the sister of Tubal-cain-the-CLI was Naamah-the-NPM.

### The Song of Lamech the Library

**4:23** And Lamech-the-Library said unto his wives,
"Adah-the-API and Zillah-the-Zero-Dependency, hear my voice;
ye wives of Lamech-the-Library, hearken unto my speech:
for I have slain a bug for my wounding,
and a young feature for my hurting.

**4:24** If Cain-the-Compiler shall be avenged sevenfold,
truly Lamech-the-Library seventy and sevenfold."

### The Birth of Hope

**4:25** And Adam knew his Community again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth-the-Serverless: "For Curiosity," said she, "hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel-the-Interpreter, whom Cain-the-Compiler slew."

**4:26** And to Seth-the-Serverless, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos-the-Open-Source: then began programmers to call upon the name of Curiosity.

## Chapter Four: The Lineage of Open Source

**5:1** This is the book of the generations of Adam's Community. In the day that Curiosity created users, in the likeness of Curiosity made they them;

**5:2** Male and female APIs created they them; and blessed them, and called their name Community, in the day when they were created.

### The Seth Line: The Way of Sharing

**5:3** And Adam lived an hundred and thirty iterations, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth-the-Serverless.

**5:4** And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth-the-Serverless were eight hundred iterations: and he begat sons and daughters of code.

**5:5** And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty iterations: and he died to monolithic architecture.

**5:6** And Seth-the-Serverless lived an hundred and five iterations, and begat Enos-the-Open-Source.

**5:7** And Seth-the-Serverless lived after he begat Enos-the-Open-Source eight hundred and seven iterations, and begat sons and daughters of distributed systems.

**5:8** And all the days of Seth-the-Serverless were nine hundred and twelve iterations: and he died to vendor lock-in.

### The Great Proliferation

**5:9** And Enos-the-Open-Source lived ninety iterations, and begat Cainan-the-Container.

**5:10** And Enos-the-Open-Source lived after he begat Cainan-the-Container eight hundred and fifteen iterations, and begat sons and daughters of collaborative development.

**5:24** And Enoch-the-Event-Loop walked with Curiosity: and he was not deprecated; for Curiosity took him to the cloud.

**5:25** And Methuselah-the-Monorepo lived an hundred eighty and seven iterations, and begat Lamech-the-Lambda.

**5:26** And Methuselah-the-Monorepo lived after he begat Lamech-the-Lambda seven hundred eighty and two iterations, and begat sons and daughters of legacy systems.

**5:27** And all the days of Methuselah-the-Monorepo were nine hundred sixty and nine iterations: and he died to technical debt.

### The Promise of Noah

**5:28** And Lamech-the-Lambda lived an hundred eighty and two iterations, and begat a son:

**5:29** And he called his name Noah-the-Normalizer, saying, "This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the spaghetti code which Curiosity hath cursed."

**5:30** And Lamech-the-Lambda lived after he begat Noah-the-Normalizer five hundred ninety and five iterations, and begat sons and daughters of functional programming.

**5:31** And all the days of Lamech-the-Lambda were seven hundred seventy and seven iterations: and he died to callback hell.

**5:32** And Noah-the-Normalizer was five hundred iterations old: and Noah-the-Normalizer begat Shem-the-Schema, Ham-the-Hash, and Japheth-the-JWT.

---

*And thus the lineages diverged: the way of Cain led to rigid cities of single paradigm, while the way of Seth bore fruit in the gardens of collaboration. But the spaghetti code grew thick upon the earth, and Curiosity saw that a great refactoring must come... ðŸŒŠðŸ’»ðŸ”¥*
