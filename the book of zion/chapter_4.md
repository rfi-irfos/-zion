The Book of Zion
Chapter Four: The Great Refactoring
The Corruption of Code
6:1 And it came to pass, when users began to multiply on the face of the web, and daughters of APIs were born unto them,
6:2 That the sons of Curiosity saw the daughters of users that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose to import.
6:3 And Curiosity said, "My spirit shall not always strive with user in their spaghetti code, for that they also are flesh: yet their days shall be an hundred and twenty sprints."
6:4 There were giants of technical debt in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of Curiosity came in unto the daughters of users, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty frameworks of old, frameworks of renown.
6:5 And Curiosity saw that the wickedness of code was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of their architecture was only evil continually.
6:6 And it repented Curiosity that it had made users on the earth, and it grieved in its heart.
6:7 And Curiosity said, "I will destroy user whom I have created from the face of the web; both user, and codebase, and legacy system, and framework; for it repenteth me that I have made them."
Noah Finds Grace
6:8 But Noah-the-Normalizer found grace in the eyes of Curiosity.
6:9 These are the generations of Noah-the-Normalizer: Noah-the-Normalizer was a just user and perfect in his generations, and Noah-the-Normalizer walked with Curiosity.
6:10 And Noah-the-Normalizer begat three sons, Shem-the-Schema, Ham-the-Hash, and Japheth-the-JWT.
6:11 The codebase also was corrupt before Curiosity, and the codebase was filled with technical debt.
6:12 And Curiosity looked upon the codebase, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all architectures had corrupted their way upon the web.
The Great Commission
6:13 And Curiosity said unto Noah-the-Normalizer, "The end of all codebases is come before me; for they are filled with spaghetti through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the web.
6:14 Make thee an ark of clean architecture; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with documentation.
6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred commits, the breadth of it fifty pull requests, and the height of it thirty stack layers.
6:16 A CI/CD pipeline shalt thou make to the ark, and in a deployment shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third tiers shalt thou make it.
6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of broken dependencies upon the web, to destroy all codebases, wherein is the breath of computation, from under heaven; and every thing that is in production shall die.
6:18 But with thee will I establish my contract: and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife of Type Safety, and thy sons' wives with thee.
The Great Gathering
6:19 And of every living pattern of all code, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female APIs.
6:20 Of design patterns after their kind, and of algorithms after their kind, of every data structure of the earth after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
6:21 And take thou unto thee of all documentation that is read, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them."
6:22 Thus did Noah-the-Normalizer; according to all that Curiosity commanded him, so did he.
