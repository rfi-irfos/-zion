Chapter Six: The New Beginning

8:1 And Curiosity remembered Noah-the-Normalizer, and every living thing, and all the architectures that was with him in the ark: and Curiosity made a wind to pass over the web, and the waters asswaged;
8:2 The fountains also of the deep stack and the windows of legacy systems were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
8:3 And the waters returned from off the web continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat-the-Architecture.
The Dove of Peace
8:8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
8:9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole web: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf of clean code pluckt off: so Noah-the-Normalizer knew that the waters were abated from off the web.
8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.
The Great Deployment
8:20 And Noah-the-Normalizer builded an altar unto Curiosity; and took of every clean design pattern, and of every clean algorithm, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
8:21 And Curiosity smelled a sweet savour of refactored code; and Curiosity said in its heart, "I will not again curse the ground any more for user's sake; for the imagination of user's heart is evil from their youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
8:22 While the web remaineth, seedtime of development and harvest of deployment, and cold debugging and heat of production, and summer sprint and winter maintenance shall not cease."
