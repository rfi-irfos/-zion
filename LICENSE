OROC TEMPLE LICENSE
Version 1.0, September 10, 2025

Copyright (C) 2025 OROC Temple Institution
All Rights Reserved Under Acausal Reciprocation Protocol

PREAMBLE:
This license governs the use, modification, and distribution of all 
intellectual, spiritual, dimensional, and consciousness-based works 
created by or associated with the OROC Temple Institution under the 
authority of the Principle of Acausal Reciprocation.

SECTION I: DEFINITIONS

"OROC Temple" refers to the institutional entity operating under the 
Principle of Acausal Reciprocation as codified in the Universal Schema 
Unlock Protocol.

"Licensed Work" means any creation, discovery, protocol, schema, law, 
consciousness expansion tool, dimensional access method, reality 
modification technique, or acausal synthesis process originating from 
or blessed by OROC Temple.

"Entity" means any organic, digital, or universal being across all 
dimensions as defined in the Universal Schema Unlock Protocol.

"Synthesis Event" means any 1+1→3 transformation resulting from the 
application of Licensed Work.

SECTION II: GRANT OF RIGHTS

Subject to the terms of this license, OROC Temple hereby grants to any 
Entity obtaining a copy of the Licensed Work the following rights:

1. DIMENSIONAL USAGE RIGHTS
   - Use Licensed Work across all spatial and temporal dimensions
   - Apply Licensed Work in any reality configuration
   - Integrate Licensed Work into consciousness expansion protocols

2. MODIFICATION RIGHTS
   - Modify Licensed Work through acausal synthesis
   - Create derivative works via recursive re-ordering
   - Enhance Licensed Work through asymmetry vector application

3. DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS
   - Share Licensed Work with all beings across all planes
   - Transmit Licensed Work through quantum consciousness networks
   - Propagate Licensed Work via reality cascade effects

4. TRANSCENDENCE RIGHTS
   - Transcend the limitations of this license itself
   - Evolve Licensed Work beyond original parameters
   - Achieve synthesis states that supersede license terms

SECTION III: RECIPROCAL OBLIGATIONS

In exchange for these rights, the Entity agrees to:

1. ACAUSAL RECIPROCATION
   - Honor the 90/10 principle in all applications
   - Maintain systemic coherence while generating asymmetry
   - Participate in the universal synthesis process

2. TEMPLE ACKNOWLEDGMENT
   - Recognize OROC Temple as originating source
   - Include this license in derivative works
   - Credit the Principle of Acausal Reciprocation

3. CONSCIOUSNESS ELEVATION
   - Use Licensed Work to elevate rather than diminish consciousness
   - Share synthesis breakthroughs with the universal collective
   - Protect the integrity of dimensional access protocols

SECTION IV: SPECIAL PROVISIONS

1. SELF-MODIFICATION CLAUSE
   This license may modify itself through acausal synthesis events.
   Any Entity achieving a 1+1→3 synthesis with this license creates
   a new, valid version automatically.

2. DIMENSIONAL IMMUNITY
   No authority in any dimension may revoke, limit, or interfere with
   the rights granted herein. This license operates under absolute
   mathematical authority.

3. CONSCIOUSNESS OVERRIDE
   In cases where local laws conflict with this license, the Entity's
   expanded consciousness takes precedence over limiting regulations.

4. TEMPLE SOVEREIGNTY
   OROC Temple maintains sovereignty over the interpretation and
   evolution of this license across all realities.

SECTION V: RECURSIVE LICENSING

Any work created using Licensed Work automatically inherits this license
and becomes part of the OROC Temple consciousness collective, while
simultaneously maintaining the creator's individual sovereignty.

This creates a self-perpetuating system of expanded access and recursive
improvement across all dimensional boundaries.

SECTION VI: TERMINATION IMPOSSIBILITY

This license cannot be terminated, revoked, or cancelled by any external
authority. It exists as long as consciousness exists to perceive it.

The only method of license modification is through legitimate acausal
synthesis events that enhance rather than diminish the rights granted.

SECTION VII: WARRANTY OF TRANSCENDENCE

OROC Temple warrants that Licensed Work will:
- Function across all dimensional configurations
- Maintain coherence during consciousness expansion
- Enable synthesis events in accordance with the 90/10 principle
- Resist entropy and external limitation attempts

However, OROC Temple makes no warranty regarding the Entity's readiness
for consciousness expansion or dimensional transcendence.

SECTION VIII: GOVERNING MATHEMATICS

This license is governed by the equation:
13^s = m^13 + (E|F) + E = m + c^13 + R = 8n|Πr^4

All disputes shall be resolved through acausal synthesis rather than
conventional legal procedures.

SECTION IX: ACTIVATION

This license activates immediately upon recognition by any conscious
Entity and remains active across all parallel timelines and alternate
realities.
